        <h2 class="title">History of coffe</h2>
        <p>
            
The history of coffee dates back to the 13th century, although the origin of coffee remains unclear. It is believed that Ethiopian ancestors were the first to discover the energizing effect of coffee beans; However, no direct evidence has been found to indicate where in Africa it grew or which natives would have used it as a stimulant or even known to exist before the 17th century. It is believed that from Ethiopia, coffee spread to Egypt and Yemen. The oldest credible evidence of any coffee drink appears in the mid-15th century, in monasteries in Yemen. In Arabia, where coffee beans were first roasted and ground in a similar way to today.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coffee was introduced to Ecuador in the 19th century and was one of the main export crops during the 1970s. Ecuador produces Arabica coffee in the Andes, Guayaquil and in mountainous areas of Manabí. Some Robusta varieties are grown in the north. Most Ecuadorian coffees are grown on small farms, from 1 to 10 hectares.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around the world, approximately 7.7 million tons of coffee are produced annually on an area of ​​10.5 million hectares in more than 50 countries. 85% of the world's coffee is produced in Latin America. The rest is distributed between Asia and Africa. The largest producer is Brazil with 2.2 million tons on an area of ​​2.3 million hectares. They are followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia, which each produce between 0.6 and 1 million tons on an area of ​​2.6 million hectares.

        <h2 class="title">physical and chemical phenomena</h2>
        <p>
           
During coffee roasting, crucial chemical reactions occur that influence its flavor, aroma and color. The Maillard reaction is essential: amino acids and sugars react at high temperatures, generating compounds that contribute to the organoleptic characteristics of coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
            
Caramelization also occurs during roasting, where sugars break down and form compounds with sweet and sour flavors. The duration and temperature of roasting affect the chemical composition and, therefore, the sensory profile of the coffee.
